## 🌙 Story Behind the Design

In a quiet little town, there lived an old man named **Mr. Desai**.  
Every evening, after tending to his garden and sipping a warm cup of tea, he would settle into his armchair as the day faded away.  

One night, he dreamt of a **tavern floating among the clouds** — where bottles of whiskey, rum, wine, and beer danced in the air, each one telling its own story.  
Every sip brought back laughter, warmth, and cherished memories.  

When he awoke, he realized that the magic of a perfect drink isn’t just in the glass — it’s in the **stories and emotions it inspires**.  

That dream became the inspiration for **Liquid Delivery: The Old Man and His Liquid Dreams** — a design that transforms nostalgia and imagination into digital experience.
